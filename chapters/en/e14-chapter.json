The enemy reinforced their positions here, likely pulling forces from the Bihać front, fulfilling one of the operation’s goals to weaken the enemy encirclement around Bihać. On the second day, the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Guards Brigade captured the important stronghold Nos and linked up with the Puma forces pushing unstoppable towards Bosansko Grahovo. On the third day, the 4th Guards Brigade was introduced, accelerating advances and encircling Bosansko Grahovo, which was liberated by the 7th and 4th Guards Brigades together on July 28. Additionally, Croatian forces took control of the strategic mountain pass Derale (965 m), disrupting the enemy communication between Knin and Banja Luka."

The 81st GB pushed towards the Glamoč – Bosansko Grahovo route, and the 2nd HVO Guards Brigade reached Poljanski vrh, establishing visual contact with the Glamoč field. Other HVO forces advanced through the Koričine pass towards Glamoč. On the fourth day, Glamoč was semi-encircled after the 81st GB liberated Ćoslije near Glamoč from the north, while HVO forces, after taking Koričine and Kujača, approached from the south. The 1st HGZ also defeated the enemy at Staretina. On the fifth day, Croatian forces entered Glamoč and continued pushing the enemy back."
