In the summer of 1991, the aggression spread across almost the entire territory of Croatia, from its easternmost part in Slavonia to the southernmost region in Dalmatia. Thus, from early autumn 1991, Dubrovnik found itself surrounded by the JNA, Montenegrin volunteers, and Serbian volunteers from eastern Herzegovina. The city was systematically attacked and destroyed until the ceasefire in 1992, while the entire surroundings of Dubrovnik, as well as all Croatian towns south of the Pelješac peninsula, were occupied and burned, with the population killed or expelled…

Opposite well-armed, equipped, and logistically supported JNA units, the Croatian side had only just formed its forces. On September 26, 1991, the Command for southern Dalmatia was established in Metković, which was soon renamed the Command of the Dubrovnik Sector…

After the ceasefire was signed in Sarajevo, at the beginning of January 1992, a reorganization of units took place in the Croatian Army to create stronger maneuver units capable of operating on any battlefield in Croatia, and on April 10, 1992, the Southern Front was formed with the goal of unifying combat actions of Croatian forces. The commander of the Southern Front, by the order of the President of the Republic of Croatia, Dr. Franjo Tuđman, was appointed General Janko Bobetko, who began clearing the Dubrovnik hinterland and completely lifting the blockade of the wider area around Dubrovnik through the establishment of this new command…

The greatest contribution to the liberation of southern Croatia was made by the assault and professional units – the 1st and 4th brigades of the Croatian National Guard, which from April to October 1992 controlled the area from the Bistrina bay to Konavle. The contribution of reserve forces and tactical groups that held the front line and operated on auxiliary attack routes was also significant…

In six months, more than 1,200 km² (8%) of occupied territory of the Republic of Croatia was liberated, allowing around 20,000 refugees to return. The battles were fought under extremely difficult weather conditions and in inaccessible and demanding karst terrain. The operations of Croatian forces on the wider Southern Front were also very important for Croats and Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina as they prevented initial attacks by Serbian forces in the areas of Mostar and the Neretva river.

Through operations Neretva, Scorched Earth, Jackal, Tiger, Liberated Land, Konavle, and Vlaštica, the far south of Croatia was defended, Dubrovnik was protected, the Dubrovnik hinterland was cleared, and enemy forces and artillery were no longer within reach to strike civilian targets in Dubrovnik and its surroundings…

The operations to liberate southern Croatia were the first in a series of successful liberation campaigns, which culminated with operations Flash and Storm, leading to the liberation of occupied areas of the Republic of Croatia.
