The joint operation of the Croatian Army, Croatian Defence Council (HVO), and the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, successfully conducted in western Bosnia from October 8 to 12, 1995, was also the last operation of Croatian forces, and the final day of the operation marked the end of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Southern Move and the new military victory of Croatian forces were a decisive move that finally militarily defeated the Serbian forces and forced them into the peace process.

•	The frontline stretched about 40 km wide, which was the narrowest among seven offensive actions by Croatian forces in this part of the frontline.
•	Around 800 square kilometers were liberated.
•	Including the Southern Move, the Split Corps area and other Croatian forces were engaged in seven offensive operations over just over a year, lasting a total of 59 days, while for the remaining 10 months and 21 days, active defense was conducted.
•	The victorious advance of the forces under the command of the Split Corps and General Ante Gotovina during the year of victories covered an area from Zemunik Gornji to Mala Manjača, approximately 140 km in length and 70 km in aerial width.


### Goals of the Southern Move

•	To push enemy forces away from Mrkonjić Grad, Podrašničko Polje (Čađavice), and the area of the hydroelectric power plant (HE) Jajce-3 (Bočac) on the Vrbas River, thereby weakening their operations against the 5th and 7th Corps of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
•	To put key roads leading to Banja Luka under control.
•	To establish a new defense line on the southern slopes of Manjača, thus enabling Croatian long-range artillery to operate against Banja Luka.


Key successes and deepest advances of Croatian forces were achieved. The 4th Guards Brigade approached Manjača, the 7th Guards Brigade reached HE Bočac, while the 1st Croatian Guards Brigade took control of Čađavica and moved toward the military training ground on Manjača. Mrkonjić Grad was liberated as the only larger settlement near Banja Luka, and the entire Podrašničko Polje and the area around HE Bočac came under Croatian control.

On the fourth day of the operation, a rotation of forces was carried out, with Croatian Army units withdrawing and Croatian Defence Council forces taking over the positions reached on the frontline. This plan was also applied in Operation Maestral after the Croatian Army strike forces had achieved most of the operation’s goals. Position fortifications and active defense continued.

The entire hydroelectric energy system on the Vrbas River was placed under Croatian control, including the only electricity supply for Banja Luka, the last Serbian stronghold.

Franjo Tuđman on the liberation of Banja Luka and Croatian Danube region:

After Operation Storm, Croatia with its forces was capable of continuing operations to liberate Banja Luka and the Croatian Danube region. However, international actors did not accept this due to concerns that a new wave of 300,000 to 500,000 refugees from those areas would inevitably lead to direct involvement of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the conflict, risking the expansion of the war and obstructing the ongoing peace efforts.

In analyses of Croatian offensive operations in the Split Corps zone of responsibility, the contribution of engineering units was particularly valued. Even under the most demanding conditions, they showed readiness and skill that ensured the successful implementation of operations. They became absolute masters of the mountains from Velebit through Svilaja, Dinara, Staretina, Šator mountain, Vitorog, Klekovača, Oštrelj, all the way to Manjača. Their achievements are reflected in numbers: in seven operations over one year, they built and repaired around 900 km of roads, fortified and built 500 shelters for combat vehicles, 840 artillery and mortar positions, 550 reinforced concrete shelters, 500 bunkers, and more than 400 shelters and camps for soldiers.

The Southern Move was a decisive strike that crushed and defeated the enemy.

Croatian Army and HVO forces once again helped the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina weaken the offensive actions undertaken against them by Serbian formations, most notably around Bosanski Novi and Ključ. As a result, the 5th and 7th Corps of the Army of BiH could now gain more favorable military positions in the Sana valley and toward Skender Vakuf, which had not been possible before.

The remnants of the Bosnian Serb forces and the broken and expelled rebel Serbs from Croatia were reduced to a narrow defensive strip around Banja Luka — the last city they tried to save and defend. Thus, their dream of Krajina was ended with the loss of this single city, only 23 km away from Croatian forces.
