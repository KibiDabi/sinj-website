This was another defeat for the Bosnian Serbs and the remaining rebel Serbian units from Croatia who still defended the wider area of Banja Luka. Thus, the Maestral operation pushed toward the end of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the definitive military defeat of the Serbian army."

The only solution was to defeat them militarily again and bring them to the negotiating table."

On the first day of the operation, which started in the morning under fog and low clouds, the enemy defense was breached and initial Croatian force advances were made (liberation of the village Pribelja). On the second day, the 7th Guards Brigade liberated the important Mlinište pass on the Glamoč – Mrkonjić Grad road, the 4th Guards Brigade reached Jastrebnjak, and the 1st Croatian Guards Brigade, together with HVO forces and special units from Herzegovina, advanced to the Vitorog mountain. On the fourth day, HVO forces liberated Demirovac mountain above Kupres, successfully completing the first phase of the operation.\r\\nContinuing the operation, the goal was the liberation of Šipovo, achieved on the fifth day by the 1st Guards Brigade, the 60th Guards Brigade of HVO, and members of the Croatian Army’s Intelligence and Reconnaissance Service. The 81st Guards Brigade of the Croatian Army was also introduced into combat along this attack direction. This was followed by the liberation of the villages Trnovo, Majdan, Čitluk, Gornji Volar, Ljuša, Kasumi, Gornji Baraći, as well as Gornja and Donja Pecka. On the sixth day, Jajce was liberated, completing all the set goals on this attack direction."
