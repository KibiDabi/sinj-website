### Military Operation "Storm" 1995 – Split Corps Area

The Split Corps Area planned and carried out Operation "Summer-95," which paved the way for Operation "Storm." Together with special police units from the Ministry of Interior, the Split Corps Area had the main task of capturing the towns of Knin and Gračac. In case the majority of the 7th North Dalmatian Corps of the "SVK" was surrounded or forced to withdraw into Bosnia and Herzegovina, the operation would enable the liberation of Dalmatia. Strategically, capturing Knin was one of the most important goals of the entire operation. Knin was the center and symbol of the Croatian Serb rebellion against Zagreb, and its fall would send a clear message to the "RSK Government" and the people that their proto-state had come to an end.

The military impact of capturing Knin and Gračac, both key traffic junctions, would cut off the "SVK" forces in a large pocket between Benkovac and Knin, forcing them to surrender or quickly retreat toward Bosnia along the Otrić–Donji Srb route. The Split Corps Area planned to conduct the mission along two main directions. The first attack direction towards Knin would come from positions around Bosansko Grahovo and Dinara. The second direction would advance over Velebit toward Gračac. The rest of the corps area, organized into three operational groups, would conduct frontal attacks on "SVK" positions around Benkovac, Kistanje, and Drniš, tying down enemy forces or, if possible, breaking through their lines to accelerate the operation. The total strength of forces was about 30,000 soldiers, including support personnel.

The Serbian 7th North Dalmatian Corps had the primary task to defend against attacks from the Split Corps Area. The corps had two motorized brigades and four infantry or light brigades on the frontline from the Bosnian border to Velebit, while a brigade from the 15th Lika Corps defended the Velebit–Gračac direction. The Croatian Army’s advance over Dinara–Livno valley during "Summer-95" severely disrupted the corps' defense and forced it to expose its brigades and scarce reserves to cover the "back door" from Grahovo, now under Croatian control. Newly formed reserve forces, Tactical Group-3, had little chance of stopping the new strike from Grahovo. The 2nd Guards Brigade of the corps’ special forces, which moved toward Grahovo in July, was stationed in Knin but was not part of TG-3. The realization that their positions had been completely turned around likely had a strong impact on the morale of the 10,000 men in the 7th Corps.

### Execution of Operation "Storm"

Standing motionless among their cumbersome war machines like statues in the dark, 135,000 Croatian soldiers dropped their cigarettes, climbed onto tanks, trucks, and armored vehicles, and advanced into Krajina, which was under Serbian occupation. This is how "Storm" began before dawn on August 4, 1995. Within a few hours, Croatian commanders knew their operation’s code name was well chosen. Wherever Serbian soldiers—about 40,000 with 400 tanks—were located, they were retreating at sunrise. In just over a day, the Croatian flag was flying over the fortress in Knin, high above Krajina.

### Split Corps Area – "Storm-4"

On the first day of "Storm," forces from the Split Corps Area broke through the initial defensive lines of enemy units around Knin. The Tactical Group-3 forces of "SVK," which defended Knin, were neutralized. Operational Group Sinj took control of the frontline from Pitomi vrh to the town of Ružić. After the first day of fighting, Operational Group Zadar established the frontline Stružnica–Duliba–Tulove Grede, enabling the use of the Obrovac–Mali Alan–Sveti Rok route for introducing equipment from the Ministry of Interior’s Special Police. Operational Group Šibenik secured the frontline from Čista Velika through Pamučar to Dugovac. Special police units successfully breached the first enemy defensive line and took control of dominant heights on Velebit. They managed to break through in the Ćelavac peak area and along the main road to Gračac.


### Split Corps Area – "Storm-4," August 5, 1995

Due to the success of the first day, Split Corps forces liberated Knin. During the night of August 4–5, the "RSK" government and the "SVK General Staff" retreated 35 kilometers north of Knin. On the supporting direction Stružnice–Ošćenica–Male Jasle–Golovro, Split Corps forces defeated the enemy and joined with special police units. By the end of the second day, Obrovac and Benkovac were liberated. The special police units fully controlled the Gospić–Gračac road on the second day. Lovinac and Medak were also liberated near Gračac.


### Split Corps Area – "Storm-4," August 6, 1995

Split Corps forces pushed the enemy toward the Bosnia and Herzegovina border and introduced fresh units into Obrovac. Special police units continued advancing north through Bruvno toward Donji Lapac, linking up with parts of the Gospić Corps forces in Udbina, having taken control of Malovan, Bruvno, and Otrić. They also took control of the Gračac–Bruvno road.


### Split Corps Area – "Storm-4," August 7

Split Corps forces secured the line Strmica–Plavno–Otrić–Gračac and in the afternoon linked up with special police in the village of Otrić. Special police units in Udbina joined with Gospić Corps forces, while other units with artillery support took control of Gornji and Donji Lapac, and a third part held the Malovan–Otrić connection. In the afternoon, special police secured the western bank of the Una River near Kulen Vakuf.


### August 8, 1995

Minister of Defense Gojko Šušak addressed the public at a press conference announcing that Operation "Storm" was successfully completed on August 7, 1995, at 6 p.m. In the afternoon, terms and methods for the surrender of the 21st Corps of "SVK" were agreed upon, and they surrendered on August 9 in the wider Glin area. Before that, Zagreb Corps forces began an attack around 11 a.m. on Dvor na Uni and liberated it early in the afternoon. Search and securing of liberated areas began, and some Croatian Army units advanced into Bosnia and Herzegovina.
