### JEŽEVIĆ – New Church of the Holy Savior

The church was built between 1967 and 1969. The new Church of the Holy Savior was erected in Ježević due to the prohibition imposed on the Catholic people from visiting the old Croatian Church of the Holy Savior at the Cetina spring. It was completely destroyed by the rebel Serb-Chetniks.

### Holy Savior (9th century) at the Cetina spring

The state authorities, in collusion with the local Orthodox population, prevented the Croats from worshipping because of the constant claims of the Svetosavska Church over Croatian cultural and sacred heritage. Thanks to the Svetosavska myth about the origin of the Church of the Holy Savior at the Cetina spring, it was not destroyed during the Homeland War.
