On August 25, 1991, in the early morning hours, a joint attack by the JNA and Serbian paramilitary forces began on Kijevo and the Vrlički area.


In the battles around Vrličko, Ante Barać, Ive Lelas, Ilija Perajica, and Ivan Tomaš were killed, and in Kijevo, Frane Jurić Arambašić lost his life.


JNA officer Ratko Mladić led the attack on Kijevo, Vrlika, and the Vrlički area on August 25, 1991. The JNA attacked unarmed civilians and Croatian police officers armed only with personal infantry weapons using tanks, artillery, mortars, and aircraft.


The attack on Vrlika lasted over 4 hours with more than 300 mortar shells fired; Kijevo was shelled with tank shells and multiple rocket launchers. Then came the air attack using banned cluster bombs.
A call was made to Major General Špiro Niković in Knin to stop bombing civilians and buildings. Around 5 p.m., due to the large concentration and superiority of the enemy forces, positions in Vrlika were abandoned.


The village of Otišić, which had been a stronghold of Serbian paramilitary forces until yesterday, was cleared by Croatian forces without casualties. A large quantity of weapons and military equipment was found in the houses, and the Ministry of the Interior personnel recommended to the civilians who had left the village to return home as there was no reason to fear.


In response to the Greater Serbian aggression, on the same day around 1:30 p.m., Croatian defenders attacked the JNA barracks “Kula” and “Tadija Anušić” in Sinj, and the military training ground Kukuzovac was blocked. In the attack on these facilities, defenders and Croatian volunteers Ivan Kamber from Ruda (barracks “Kula”) and Luka Erceg from Otok (barracks “Tadija Anušić”) were killed.
